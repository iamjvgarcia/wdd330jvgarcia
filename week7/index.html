                Errors, Exceptions, and Warnings
            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Errors</b> ― caused when something goes wrong in a program.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li> usually caused by one of the following:
                        <ul>
                            <li>System error ― there’s a problem with the system or external devices with which the
                                program
                                is interacting.
                            </li>
                            <li>Programmer error ― the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it could even
                                be
                                as simple as a typo.
                            </li>
                            <li>Programmer error ― the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it could even
                                be
                                as simple as a typo.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>Exceptions</b>― an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the program to
                    deal with the error</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>An exception will also produce astack trace</li>
                    <li><b>Stack Traces </b>― is a sequence of functions or method calls that lead to the point where
                        the
                        error occurred.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><b>Warnings </b>―can occur if there’s an error in the code that isn't enough to cause the program to
                    crash.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>
                Strict Mode
            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Strict mode encourages a better quality of JavaScript to be written that befits a ninja programmer, so its use is recommended.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>
                Feature Detection
            </h3>

                <li>used to determine browser support for a feature</li>
