            <h3>
                Higher-Order Functions
            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The length of the code is not important. What matters is how it was written.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li> Abstractions - hide details and give us the ability to talk about problems at a higher (or more
                        abstract) level. </li>
                </ul>

            </ul>
            <h3>
                Further Functions

            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Immediately Invoked Function Expression – or IIFE - an anonymous function that is invoked as soon
                    as it’s defined. </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Placing any code that uses the temporary variable inside an IIFE will ensure it’s only available
                        while the IIFE is invoked, then it will disappear.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li> Recursive Functions - one that invokes itself until a certain condition is met. It’s a useful tool
                    to use when iterative processes are involved. </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>
                Ajax
           </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Ajax is a technique for sending and receiving data asynchronously in the background.</li>
            </ul>
