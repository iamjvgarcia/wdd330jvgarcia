                <ul>
                    <li>Two types of client side validation</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p class="code">Built-in form validation -</p> uses HTML5 form validation features, which
                            we've discussed in many places throughout this module. This validation generally doesn't
                            require much JavaScript. Built-in form validation has better performance than JavaScript,
                            but it is not as customizable as JavaScript validation.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p class="code">JavaScript validation -</p> is coded using JavaScript. This validation is
                            completely customizable, but you need to create it all (or use a library).
                        </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Web Storage</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Web Storage API provides a key-value store on the clientâ€™s computer that is similar to
                            using cookies but has fewer restrictions, more storage capacity, and is generally easier to
                            use. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Geolocation</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The Geolocation API is used to obtain the geographical position of the device.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Web Workers</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Web workers allow processes to be run in the background, adding support for concurrency in
                            JavaScript.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Shared Web Workers </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>These are linked to the script that loaded the worker, and are unable to be used by another
                            script.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Service Workers </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Service Worker API allows a worker script to run in the background with the added
                            benefit of being able to intercept network requests. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Websockets</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This uses a system of request and response to send data back and forth. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Notifications

                    </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This allows you to show messages using the system's notifications. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Multimedia </li>
                    <ul>

                    </ul>
                    <li>A shim or polyfill is a piece of code that adds support of missing features to older browsers.
